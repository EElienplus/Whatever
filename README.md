# Whatever
**Whatever** is a simple game making framework based of Raylib! (GUI may come later ;)
It is made to continue the current style of raylib and match it's simplicity. You can tell a function or something is from **Whatever** because it is written in camel case, instead of pascal case. So far, this is just an visual studio solution. But in the future, I might be able to get 2 versions out. 1 which will be just a single header, or maybe a dll (just a framework). And a normal executable which *might* be the GUI version. We'll see. atm this is just a repo to keep my stuff backed up, so I don't even know how you ended up over here. You're still welcome though :P!
